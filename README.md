# Quraan Player

Welcome to the Quraan Player! Follow the steps below to set up and launch the application.

---

## Prerequisites
1. Ensure your system meets the required specifications for running the application.
2. Confirm the database is configured to store song paths in this format:  
   `C:\Quraan\path`

---

## Installation Guide
1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   Use the following command to clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Organize Files**:  
   - Find the `Quraan` folder in the cloned repository.  
   - **Cut** the `Quraan` folder and move it to the `C:\` directory.  
     > This step is essential since the database relies on the `C:\Quraan\path` format for song paths.

3. **Backup Database**:  
   If needed, back up your existing database to prevent data loss during setup.

## Launching the Application
1. Navigate to the folder containing the applicationâ€™s executable file.
2. Start the application by double-clicking the executable or using your preferred method.

---

## Troubleshooting
If the application fails to start:
1. Ensure the `Quraan` folder is placed directly in `C:\`.
2. Verify that the database contains the correct song paths in `C:\Quraan\path`.
3. Double-check for missing or misplaced files during the setup process.

## Notes
- Any deviation from the steps above might prevent the application from functioning.
- Double-check all paths and placements to ensure proper setup.
